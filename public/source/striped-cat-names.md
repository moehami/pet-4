## Historical Perspective

Cats with stripes have been revered throughout history. They have appeared in the art and culture of ancient civilizations worldwide, spanning from Egypt to Europe and Asia.

In ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped due to their importance in controlling pests and rodents. The most revered cat breed was the African wildcat, which sported distinctive stripes. Cats were seen as guardians, protecting households and bringing prosperity. It is no surprise, then, that the Egyptian cat goddess Bastet was often depicted with leopard spots or stripes. 

Meanwhile, in ancient Japan, the Maneki Neko figurine—otherwise known as the lucky cat—has often been depicted with stripes. Today, these figurines are given as gestures of good luck, and one can often find them in businesses, homes, and even restaurants.
