Basic Tips for Naming Your Dog

Before we delve into apricot-specific names, here are some basic tips for naming your dog, no matter what color they are: 

1. Keep it short and simple. 

This is probably the most important aspect of choosing a name for your dog. You want a name that is easy to pronounce and not too long. Dogs have shorter attention spans than us, and they listen for cues in their names more than the actual spelling or length. Shorter names are easier for you to say repeatedly and will help with training. 

2. Avoid names that sound similar to commands. 

You want to choose a name that your dog can distinguish from commands you will be saying frequently, such as "sit," "stay," or "come." For example, "Ray" might be a poor choice because it sounds like "stay," which could cause some confusion for your pup. 

3. Choose a name that is special to you. 

You will be saying your dog's name a lot, so it should be a name you at least like! If there is a name from your childhood you have always loved or a name that has significance to you and your family, consider using it for your new pup. 

4. Test it out. 

Say the top choices out loud to make sure they feel like a fit. You can even get your family together and take a vote if you have a few favorite options. When you narrow it down to 2-3 top choices, say each of them out loud repeatedly, especially nearby your pup to see if they seem to respond to any more than the others. You may just know when you've found the right one. 

5. Be patient with naming decisions. 

It's okay if you don't decide on a name right away. Give yourself some time to get to know your pup's personality, and perhaps the perfect name will come to you in the meantime. Some pet parents know right away, while others may take a few days or weeks.

Tips for Teaching Your Dog Their Name and Building Association

Now that you've chosen the perfect name for your apricot pup, you may wonder how you can help them learn it and associate it with themselves. Here are some tips for teaching your dog its name and building this association: 

1. Use a consistent tone. 

When you're first teaching your dog its name, it can help to use the same tone each time you say it. This helps them learn to recognize it faster. Use a positive, upbeat tone, not harsh or demanding. 

2. Keep training sessions short. 

Your pup's attention span is probably pretty short, so try to keep training sessions under ten minutes. You can do multiple sessions a day, but try not to exhaust your pup or bore them. They will enjoy the interaction more if you keep it short and fun. 

3. Use treats and praise. 

Puppy training basics suggest using positive reinforcement with treats and praise to train your dog. When they hear their name and look at you, reward them with praise and a treat. 

4. Use their name in daily life. 

Use their name in daily life, not just during training sessions. For example, call them by name when it's time for dinner, walks, or playtime. This helps them associate their name with everyday activities and routines. 

5. Avoid saying their name in a negative tone. 

You want your pup to associate their name with positive things, not negative. So, avoid saying their name when you're angry or scolding them. If you need to get their attention when they're doing something wrong, try a different command or use their name alongside a positive command like "sit" or "come." 

6. Be patient! 

Learning takes time, and your pup is constantly learning new things every day. Their name is one of the first words they learn, and with your guidance and patience, they will learn it quickly. 

7. Use nicknames. 

If your dog's name is Apollo, you might call them "Apie" or "Apes" sometimes to help them associate with their nickname too. 

8. Use hand signals. 

When your dog's name is said, they should associate it with looking at you. Practice this with a specific hand signal, such as putting your hand out, palm up, as if you are saying, "stop." This can help your pup understand what "looking at you" means when they hear their name. 

9. Be careful with nicknames. 

Once your dog has learned its name, you can give it variations, such as "Apricot" or "Apie." Be careful with this, as you don't want your dog to get confused with too many options.
