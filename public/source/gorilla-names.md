## Gorilla Naming Tips and Guidelines 

When it comes to naming your gorilla, there are a few guidelines you want to follow. 

- Keep it short. Gorilla names should be easy to pronounce and not too long. 

- Avoid names that sound too much like commands. You don't want your gorilla to confuse its name with a directive since this may cause behavioral issues. 

- Positive reinforcement is key. Choose a name that you can use to praise your gorilla, not one that you will have a hard time saying without scowling. This will ensure positive reinforcement during training and everyday interactions. 

- Use distinct names when managing a group. If you have multiple gorillas, each needs a unique name to distinguish one from another. You can give them names that contrast or complement each other, but they should not sound too similar. 

## Handraising a Gorilla

If you've stumbled upon this blog post, chances are you're looking for the perfect name for your gorilla companion. Perhaps you're engaged in gorilla fostering or conservation efforts, or you work at a zoo. In any case, you've come to the right place for inspiration. 

While humans have been naming animals for centuries, gorillas aren't necessarily named in the same way we would name our pets or give names to our human children. Often, it's the caregivers or conservationists who assign a name based on a set of guidelines and criteria. Typically, researchers avoid naming gorillas with names that could be deemed offensive or disrespectful to the gorilla's personhood. 

Gorillas can become emotionally attached to their human caregivers and the names they are given, so it's important to choose wisely. 

Let's explore some essential tips for naming your gorilla, along with a wide variety of creative options to inspire you. 

## Gorilla Name Ideas Derived by Gender

In the world of gorilla care and conservation, there are no hard and fast rules about distinguishing between names typically associated with genders in the human world. Unlike naming human children, the names we choose for gorillas are not necessarily inspired by gender, personality, or appearance alone. 

However, some gorilla caregivers and researchers still lean into the gender distinction when naming their subjects, especially when they notice gender-specific behaviors or when they want to honor the individual's gender. 

Generally, here are some guidelines and ideas for naming based on gender. 

### Female Gorillas

- Angela, Angela Merkel, and Angela Davis are iconic feminist figures that inspire many. Consider paying homage to them through a namesake for your beloved female gorilla. 

- Annie Oakley was an American sharpshooter and performer who gained fame for her amazing skills. She was known for her confidence and strength, traits you may see in your female gorilla. 

- How about paying homage to some of the great women authors of our time, like Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, or Kate Atkinson? You could rename your gorilla after their literary works, character names, or initials. For example, you might choose Maya for a confident female gorilla. 

- Nature-inspired names are also a wonderful option, and there are many beautiful species of flowers and trees that are commonly associated with women. Consider calling your female gorilla Violet, Lily, Iris, Saige, or Willow. 

### Male Gorillas

- There are numerous renowned male figures throughout history that have inspired and championed equality, like Barack Obama, Martin Luther King Jr., and Mahatma Gandhi. You might consider naming your male gorilla after them as a testament to their legacy. 

- Or, you can look to the entertainment industry and rename your gorilla after famous actors, musicians, or other cultural icons. For example, Elvis, Bowie, and Freddie are fun and unique names that pay homage to legendary performers. 

- Nature is an endless source of inspiration, and there are many masculine and bold animal names to consider. For example, you might name your gorilla Titan, Crusher, or Beast. These names are strong and commanding but also unique and interesting. 

## Gorilla Names Derived from Personality or Appearance

Sometimes, gorillas are named based on quirky or unique characteristics that their caregivers notice about them. These names can be inspired by personality traits, favorite foods or toys, or even physical attributes that are notable or memorable. 

Additionally, some researchers develop a naming theme for the group of gorillas they are managing. This can aid in differentiation and identification, especially when interacting with a group of gorillas in a conservation setting. 

Here's an exploration of some ideas derived from personality, appearance, and context. 

### Personality-Based Names

- If your gorilla is exceptionally playful, consider naming them after games or playthings. For example, Nintendo originated the character of Mario, the famous Italian Plumber we all know and love. You might shorten it to Mario, or even Mama, to highlight their playful side. 

- Lovable and sweet gorillas deserve a name that reflects their gentle spirit. Consider naming them after sweet treats like Candy, Cocoa, or Frodo (short for Frodo Baggins from The Lord of the Rings, who also represents an innocent and loving creature). 

- Brave and fearless gorillas can be named after iconic superheroes. While names like Batman and Superman are commonly used, you can also get creative with lesser-known comic book characters like Nightcrawler or Jean Grey. 

### Appearance-Based Names

- Some gorillas have physical characteristics or marking that are noticeable and memorable. These can be used as inspiration for their names. For example, a gorilla with a lightning-shaped stripe on its back could be named Thundersley. 

- Gorillas can have playful and fun facial expressions that may remind you of certain celebrities, such as Andy Capp, the iconic comic character known for his frowny face. If your gorilla has a characteristic expression, consider naming them after a funny or noteworthy celebrity. 

- Other gorillas are known for their gorgeous manes, resembling majestic lions. In this case, you can draw naming inspiration from the lion's mane. Consider names like Simba,Leo, or Cyrus (as in Cyrus the Lion from the Chronicles of Narnia series). 

## Creative Gorilla Name Ideas for Different Contexts

Depending on your relationship with the gorilla, the context of naming them arises from different considerations. 

For example, a gorilla foster parent may name their temporarily fostered gorilla with a name that is distinct from their other gorillas to avoid confusion with established family groups. Similarly, those participating in gorilla conservation efforts will assign names for practical reasons, such as ease of communication with other caregivers. 

Here are some contexts that may influence the naming process. 

### Zoo Settings

Zoos often have stringent records and databases for cataloging and tracking the whereabouts and behaviors of the animals in their care. Thus, names given to the gorillas tend to be more practical and logistical in nature, focusing on distinguishing one gorilla from another. 

In this context, there may be themes for naming different groups of gorillas, especially if a zoo houses a significant number of gorillas. There might be a chronological naming system in place, so caregivers can identify when a gorilla was born or introduced into the group. For example, all male gorillas born in the year 2023 might have the initials 'BTS,' following the names of the K-Pop band BTS. 

Alternatively, the zoo may choose to name all the gorillas in a particular group after cities, flowers, or a particular genre of music. Whatever the case, the naming process in zoos tends to be more streamlined and practical than inspirational. 

### Foster Settings

Foster parents who take in gorillas, even temporarily, may have the opportunity to name the gorilla as if it were their own. These names can be inspired by the foster parent's cultural background, personal beliefs, or favorite names. 

However, it's important to remain aware of the eventual goal of returning the gorilla to the wild. It's best to avoid naming the gorilla in a way that could be intimidating or confusing, particularly when reintroduced to their original group. 

### Conservation and Research Settings

Those working in the field of gorilla conservation and research often have entirely different motivations for naming gorillas. They may develop naming themes to easily identify and track gorillas in their care, especially if they are monitoring several groups in the wild. 

Names may focus on a particular theme, such as astronomy, and all gorillas born in a specific year may share a naming tradition. For example, all female gorillas may be named after planets, while males are named after stars. This can help researchers quickly identify each individual without confusing one with another, especially in different contexts, such as during monitoring and data collection. 

## Conclusion 

There are many considerations when naming gorillas, regardless of whether you're a caregiver, a conservationist, or simply someone looking for inspiration for a creative project. 

Naming animals, particularly gorillas, requires thoughtful consideration about how we want to define them in our human language and how these names can uphold respect and empathy. 

While there are different contexts in which gorilla names arise, we've explored a range of guidelines and inspiration sources to help you get started. 

Below, we've compiled a list of FAQs to help you answer any lingering questions. 

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 

**1. Are there any naming guidelines unique to gorillas?**

 While there are no firm guidelines in the zoos or wild, many researchers and caregivers agree that gorillas should not be given names that sound too similar to one another, as this may cause confusion. You should also avoid names that sound like a command you'd give a gorilla. 

**2. What if I want to name a gorilla after a celebrity or public figure?**

You may want to consider getting permission from the celebrity or their estate, especially if you want to trademark or register the name for commercial use. 

**3. What if I want to name a gorilla after a specific gorilla in history?**

You may choose to name your gorilla after a specific gorilla in history, such as Harambe, the gorilla killed at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2016. You might also consider naming your gorilla after legendary silverback gorillas like Alf, Zwiss, or Dumbo. 

**4. What if I want to name a gorilla after an aspect of their personality or appearance?**

Many gorillas in zoos and wildlife centers are named after their place of origin, their appearance, or their personality. Some gorillas have been named after the caregivers' favorite flowers, books, or characters. 

**5. Are there any naming strategies to differentiate groups of gorillas?**

Many zoos and wildlife centers use a particular strategy to name gorillas in a way that distinguishes one group from another. This usually includes gender, birth order, or a naming theme. 

For example, a group of gorillas may all be named after planets, and the males are named after planets that are associated with the sun (such as Venus, Mars, and Jupiter). The females are named after planets that are not associated with the sun (such as Pluto, Neptune, and Uranus). 

This strategy not only helps to differentiate individuals but also creates a cohesive group identity.
