# Fly Names: Ultimate Guide to Different Types of Flies and Their Names

Flies are incredibly important creatures that significantly impact our lives, whether we know it or not. Not only are they fascinating to observe in terms of behavior, but they are also vital to the ecosystem as contributors to various ecological processes. However, these creatures are often misunderstood, and many fear them without reason. Learning to differentiate between different fly species can help you identify the good flies from the nuisance ones. This guide aims to remove the fear by humanizing these creatures through the most comprehensive outline of fly names ever seen! 

## Introduction to Flies

Flies are insects that belong to the Diptera division, meaning "two wings." They are characterized by having two wings alongside specialized sensory organs, like antennas. Flies are among the most ancient living creatures, with evidence of fly-like fossils dating back to the Carboniferous period, around 318.3 million years ago. 

Today, this insect group includes over 240,000 species and spans numerous categories and sizes. Flies are found everywhere that humans exist, albeit many species live far away from human contact. They can be found across different habitats, including rainforests, deserts, farms, and even in our homes.

## Categories of Flies

Flies are ordered into different categories based on various characteristics that help us identify them quickly. These categories include:

### Brachycera and Cyclorrhapha

These are the shorter-winged flies, which are generally more invasive and a nuisance to humans. They include:

#### Calliphoridae

Blowflies: These flies deposit eggs on decaying flesh, leading to the development of maggots. Several species are valuable in forensics and medicine due to this trait. They are typically metallic blue or green in color and 10-25 mm long. Examples include the Green Blowfly (Phormia regina) and the Blue Blowfly (Calliphora vomitoria).

#### Luciliidae

Luciliids are small flies, with some species less than 1 mm long. They have a humpback larva, which is a key identification characteristic. They are found in leaf litter and other decaying organic material.

#### Phoridae

Lesser Dung Flies: These flies are small, averaging 2-4 mm long. They are found on dung and decaying plant matter. Phorids are distinguished by their antenna, which has a distinctive curved basal segment. 

#### Sarcophagidae

These flies can be found on carcasses or dung, though some prefer to live exclusively on detritus or decaying plant matter. They are small to medium-sized, at 2-12 mm in length. Sarcophagids are oval-shaped and moderately hairy, and they have large compound eyes.

#### Sepsidae

Sepsids, or flesh flies, are similar to the Calliphoridae in that they are attracted to decaying flesh. They are small (3-5 mm in length) and robust with a prominent proboscis. They have large compound eyes and antler-like extensions of the frontal cone. 

#### Other Brachycera and Cyclorrhapha

This category also includes other invasive fly species, such as:
- Fruit flies (including the Mediterranean and Mexican fruit fly)
- Black flies
- Sand flies

These species are discussed further down in the article.

### Orthorrhapha

These are the true flies, characterized by large, hairy, buzzing species that typically have a metallic sheen. They include:

#### Tabanidae

Horseflies and Deer Flies: These are some of the largest flies, reaching up to 3 inches in length. They have multifaceted eyes, and the females usually have a sharp, piercing mouthpart that enables them to feed on the blood of larger animals, including humans. These flies are usually gray or black with stripes. The Horse Fly (Tabanus spp.) is less common than the more bulky Deer Fly. 

#### Therevidae

These small flies (1.5-3 mm in length) are beige, orange, or black in color. They have a pointed thorax and abdomen, with the head slightly recessed between the eyes, and they have dense hairs and short antennae. They are commonly found on the edges of forests and in bush land.

#### Bombyliidae

Bombyliids, or bee flies, are small (5-20 mm long), colorful, and resemble bees, with which they share the same foraging habitat. They have an elongated proboscis, which they use to feed on nectar and pollen, and long, thin legs. 

#### Thereina

These flies are small, at 2.3-3.5 mm in length, and fragile, with a narrow abdominal segment. They are yellow, orange, or brown, with black markings and relatively short antennae. They are commonly found on foliage in urban areas, forests, and bush land.

#### Callistomini

These small (2-4 mm long) yellow and black flies prefer to live in forests and bush land, though some are found in urban areas. They have a convex shape behind the head and abbreviated antennae.

#### Syrphidae

Syrphids, or hoverflies, are small to medium-sized flies (5-20 mm) and resemble bees or wasps in color, with black and yellow stripes or yellow and black bands. They are often mistaken for wasps, owing to their resemblance. These flies have a characteristic mode of flight, hence the name "hoverfly," wherein they hover close to flowers. 

#### Eristalinae

These flies are small (2.5-4.5 mm) and yellow, black, or white. They have a narrow abdomen and ant-like tapered hind legs. They are commonly found near shallow, stagnant water and are important pollinators.

#### Bibionidae

March Flies: These large (10-20 mm) black flies have transparent wings and a dense, hairy appearance. They are often found in rural areas and forest edges, where they lay their eggs in the soil.

#### Nosodentoridae

These flies are small (2.5-4 mm) and yellow or black in color, with a narrow abdomen and antennae. They are found across various habitats, including forests, urban parks, and bush land. They have enlarged hind legs, which are characteristic of this family.

#### Culiocidae

These small (2.5-3.5 mm) flies are yellow or black, with a tapered body. They have large eyes and antenna and are commonly found near fresh or brackish water, as well as in bush land and forests.

#### Mystacinobatidae

These large (12-18 mm) flies are distinctive in appearance, with a round, shiny black body and yellow stripes. They are commonly found in New Zealand and some parts of Australia.

#### Pipunculidae

These small (1.5-3 mm) black or yellow flies have a narrow abdomen and relatively short antennae. They are commonly found on flowers and pollinate a wide range of plant species.

#### Asterophagidae

These small (1.5-3 mm) flies are found on the flower heads of Asteraceae plants. They are yellow or black in color and have a narrow abdomen.

### Thrips

These small (1-3 mm) flies are usually black or gray in color and are commonly found on plants, where they feed on the leaves and buds. They are often mistaken for mosquitoes.

### Mosquitoes

These small (2-3 mm) flies are usually black or gray in color and commonly found near stagnant water or in humid environments. They are a nuisance species known for their blood-feeding habits and ability to carry and transmit various diseases.

## Fly Behavior and Environmental Impact

Flies are generally considered a nuisance, particularly those species with a penchant for invading human personal and professional spaces. However, before we discuss the impact these creatures have on us, it's essential to acknowledge the significant role they play in the ecosystem.

Flies are integral contributors to the food chain. Their larvae tend to be keener collectors of decaying matter than worms, and they serve as food sources for a range of animals, including fish, birds, and other insects. By processing these nutrients into their various life stages, flies help to recycle organic material back into the earth, boosting soil nutrient content.

The adult flies themselves are food sources for birds, and some species of flies are prey to spiders and other insects. Indeed, several insectivores, like the famous Venus flytrap, have evolved mechanisms exclusively to catch and consume flies. 

Flies are also a critical vector for the transmission of various diseases, particularly those causing organisms that affect humans and other mammals. While flies are not responsible for the transmission of every illness, their ability to travel and frequent filth makes them highly capable of spreading disease. Flies can carry pathogens on their legs and mouths from resting and feeding on animal carcasses or waste, and they frequently transmit diseases such as cholera, dysentery, tularemia, and typhoid fever. They can also contaminate food and water sources with these pathogens.

Flies can also affect livestock and livestock products. For example, blowflies can lay eggs on animals like sheep, goats, and cows, leading to maggots hatching and causing myiasis, a condition that can be fatal. These flies can also reduce the value of meat and dairy products by contaminating them.

Despite the critical role that flies play in the environment, interactions between flies and humans are typically nuisance-based. Indeed, it is widely believed that the average house fly lives for around a month, during which time it traverses countless countertops, plates of half-eaten food, and garbage bins. These creatures are not intentionally mischievous, but rather they are attracted to certain environments and substances that are conducive to their survival and reproduction. Unfortunately, these environments often coincide with human habitation, resulting in strained relations.

House flies are particularly frustrating due to their tendency to invade homes and restaurants. These flies are attracted to exposed food, unclean surfaces, and standing water. They can quickly become a nuisance, and their presence can be irritating and unsanitary. As such, it's crucial to implement preventative measures to minimize house fly infestations.

Fortunately, there are several effective strategies for controlling fly populations and minimizing their impact on our lives. Understanding what attracts flies is the first step in preventing these nuisance insects. 

## Human Interactions with Flies: Benefits and Nuisances

Most flies are a nuisance to humans, but some can also be beneficial. Some flies are important pollinators, including the hoverflies we discussed earlier and other species like bees. They play a crucial role in the ecosystem by helping to fertilize plants, including many that we rely on for food. However, it's essential to note that these beneficial flies should not be mistaken for the invasive species that frequently cause problems.

We'll begin by exploring the category of flies that cause the most frustration among humans, particularly those in urban and suburban areas.

### House Flies

As their name suggests, house flies tend to invade human homes, as well as restaurants, bars, and other places where food is served. They are attracted to decaying organic matter, and they will lay their eggs in it. House flies are also known to spread diseases, such as cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery. They are a significant nuisance and can be difficult to get rid of once they have invaded a home or building.

House flies measure around 1/2 to 5/8 inches (11-15 mm) in length and usually have a dark stripe that runs lengthwise along their otherwise yellowish-gray bodies. They have six legs, two wings, and two antennas.

The most common type of house fly is the Musca domestica, which is found throughout the world. These flies are usually found in homes, restaurants, and other buildings where food is served or stored. They can also be found outdoors in places where there is decaying organic matter, such as garbage dumps, manure piles, and sewage facilities.

House flies can be a significant nuisance, but they can also be dangerous, as they can spread diseases. It is important to take steps to prevent house flies from invading homes and buildings and to eliminate them when they are found.

### Other Nuisance Flies

In addition to house flies, there are several other fly species that commonly invade human spaces and act as pests. Some of these include:

- Stable flies: These flies are found near barns, stables, and other places where animals are kept. They can bite animals and humans, which causes discomfort and can lead to disease transmission.
- Horse flies: These flies are found near horses and other large animals. They can bite animals and humans, which causes pain and can also transmit diseases.
- Fruit flies: These flies are found near fruit and vegetables, and they can contaminate food with their bodies and saliva. They can also spread diseases, such as malaria, to humans.
- Drain flies: These flies are found near drains, sewers, and other places where there is standing water. They can contaminate water and food with their bodies and saliva. They are also known to spread diseases, such as typhoid fever and dysentery.

These nuisance flies can be a significant problem, as they can spread diseases and contaminate food and water. It is important to take steps to prevent them from invading homes and buildings and to eliminate them when they are found.

## Fly Swatters and Other Control Methods

Despite the frustration that flies can cause, control methods are available to help mitigate their impact. Indeed, as we have discussed, preventative measures can effectively reduce fly infestations. But what about when they are already buzzing about? Let's explore some control methods, including the often underutilized fly swatter.

### Swatters and Other Devices

There is a certain nostalgia associated with the traditional fly swatter, which often evokes childhood memories of whacking flies with a trusty swatter. Indeed, there is something innately satisfying about the instantaneous gratification of watching a fly meet its end with a swift and precise swat. 

While this control method may not be the most effective, it is undoubtedly popular, with many different types of swatters available on the market. From a purely anecdotal perspective, it appears that the traditional fly swatter is on the decline, with many opting for the more modern (and often battery-operated) varieties. These new swatters claim to offer increased efficiency and effectiveness, though one must wonder if they miss the old-school thrill of the chase. 

Regardless of the style preferred, one must remember that fly swatters are best used as a preventative measure, ensuring that flies are not attracted to your home in the first place. They are also highly useful for eliminating flies that have already invaded your personal space, as they can be used both indoors and outdoors.

Other devices such as electronic fly swatters and insect traps can also be used to control flies. These devices use light, heat, or chemicals to attract and kill flies. However, they may not be as effective as they claim, and they can also be harmful to the environment.

### Natural Fly Control

There are many natural methods that can be used to control flies. Some of these include:

- Using essential oils: Some essential oils, such as peppermint, lavender, and lemongrass, can help repel flies
