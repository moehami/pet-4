**Bee Names: A Comprehensive Guide to Different Types of Bees** 

# Bee Names: A Comprehensive Guide 
## Introduction 
Bees are incredible creatures that play a crucial role in the ecosystem. They are responsible for about 1/3 of all food production through pollination, and their honey and beeswax have been used by humans for various purposes for centuries. With this in mind, it's no surprise that these hardworking insects have gained attention and fascination from people all over the world. This article will act as a comprehensive guide to different types of bees, their characteristics, behaviors, roles, and how to identify them. 

## Overview of Bee Classes 
Worldwide, there are over 20,000 species of bees, divided into 5 different classes: 
- Honeybees 
- Bumblebees 
- solitary bees 
- stingless bees 
- extinct bees (those that no longer exist) 

Each class is comprised of different species, which will be discussed further in this guide. 

## Honeybees 
### Honeybee Species 
Honeybees are the most well-known and commonly encountered type of bee. They are social bees, living in colonies that can contain thousands of individuals. They are also the only type of bee that creates structured hives, consisting of wax combs, where they store their honey and raise their young. 

There are two species of honeybees: 
1.Apis mellifera (Western honeybee): The most common honeybee species, found in Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa. They are known for their docile and passive nature, which makes them ideal for beekeeping. These bees live in a hierarchical society, with a queen, workers, and drones. 
2. Apis cerana (Eastern honeybee): Found in Southeast Asia, this species is much more aggressive than the Western honeybee and has a more extensive stinger. They also have a more substantial immunity to certain bee diseases. 

### Honeybee Behavior 
Regardless of species, all honeybees behave similarly within their colonies. They communicate through a series of intricate dances that convey information about food sources and directions. They also produce beeswax, which they use to build their hives and storage combs. Honeybees are also unique in that they can survive in colder climates, as they form a tight cluster to keep their queen warm. 

### The Queen Bee 
Honeybee colonies are led by their queen, who is the only reproductive female in the colony. Males, known as drones, are hatched from unfertilized eggs, while females, known as workers, are hatched from fertilized eggs. The queen's primary role is to lay eggs, and she can produce up to 2,000 eggs per day, ensuring the colony's continuous growth and survival. 

### Worker Bees 
Worker bees are the non-reproductive females of the colony. They have several jobs throughout their lifetimes, starting with cell cleaning, where they clean out the cells of the honeycomb to prepare them for the queen to lay eggs. They also serve as feeders, nurturing larvae, pupae, and the queen. Once they reach 12 days old, they begin their foraging missions where they collect pollen and nectar from flowers, which they then process into honey for storage. 

### Drone Bees 
Drones are the male bees in the colony. They are hatched from unfertilized eggs and exist solely to fertilize new queen bees. Drones are larger than workers and have no stinger. They spend their days resting, eating, and waiting for their chance to fly out and meet virgin queens on their mating flights. 

### How Long Do Honeybees Live? 
The lifespan of a honeybee depends on its role within the colony: 
- Queen bee: The queen can live up to 5 years and is the most long-lived member of the colony. She spends her days laying eggs and can produce millions of eggs during her lifetime. 
- Worker bee: Worker bees typically live for approximately 6 weeks during the summer months and 4-6 months during the winter. Their relatively short lifespan means they work themselves to death, as they sacrifice themselves for the greater good of the colony.
- Drone bee: Drones have a much shorter lifespan than both the queen and worker bees. They survive only to mate with the queen and live for about 10 days during the summer. In the winter, they are kicked out of the colony and die soon after. 

### Honeybee Threats and Survival Tricks 
Honeybees have several natural enemies that pose a threat to their survival, including: 
- Pest insects, such as the Varroa mite and the Asian hornet. 
- Diseases, such as Foul Brood and Chalk Brood. 
- Climate conditions, including droughts and cold winters. 

To survive these threats, honeybees have developed several survival tactics, including: 
- Their ability to adapt to changing climate conditions through their cluster behavior, maintaining a warm temperature in their hive essential for the survival of the colony. 
- Producing enough honey to last them through the winter, when flowers are not abundant. 
- Mutations in some honeybees have resulted in insecticide resistance, which helps protect them from certain pest control methods. 

## Bumblebees 
### Bumblebee Species 
Bumblebees are a type of social bee, but unlike honeybees, they live in much smaller colonies. There are approximately 250 different bumblebee species worldwide, and while they share some similarities with honeybees, they have several unique characteristics. 

### Bumblebee Behavior 
Bumblebees are robust, noisy insects that can often be seen bouncing around from flower to flower on a warm summer day. They are important pollinators and contribute significantly to the environment and agriculture. Similar to honeybees, bumblebees communicate through dances that convey information about food sources. 

### The Queen Bumblebee 
Each bumblebee colony has a queen, and as with honeybees, she is the only reproductive female in the colony. Unlike honeybee queens, however, bumblebee queens do not spend their entire lives in the nest. Instead, they spend most of their time outside, where they gather food and lay eggs. 

### Worker Bumblebees 
Worker bumblebees are born from fertilized eggs and are responsible for several tasks around the colony. They work as guards, predators, and food collectors and processors. They also take on the role of a heater for the colony, by vibrating their muscles to raise the temperature inside the nest. 

### Drone Bumblebees 
Drones are the male bees in the bumblebee colony. They arise from unfertilized eggs and exist to fertilize new queens. They spend their days resting and waiting for their chance to fertilize a queen on her mating flight. If they are unsuccessful in mating, they will die shortly after. 

### How Long Do Bumblebees Live? 
The lifespan of a bumblebee depends on its role within the colony: 
- Queen bumblebee: The queen bumblebee lives for approximately a year, spending the first part of her life accumulating food and laying eggs, and the latter part of her life hibernating over the winter. 
- Worker bumblebees: Worker bumblebees live for approximately 3 weeks during the summer months. They work themselves to death, constantly foraging for food and defending the colony. 
- Drone bumblebees: Drones live for a short time, roughly 10 days, over the summer before they are able to mate with the queen. 

### Bumblebee Threats and Survival Tactics 
Like honeybees, bumblebees also face threats from pests and diseases, as well as declining habitats and climate changes. These threats have caused many bumblebee species to decline in numbers, and some are even on the edge of extinction. 

## Solitary Bees 
### Solitary Bee Species 
While the previous two types of bees were social bees, solitary bees live up to their name and prefer to fly solo. They are arguably the most important pollinators in many ecosystems throughout the world, as they actively pollinate a wide range of plants. In fact, several solitary bee species are specialists, which means they are the only ones that will pollinate certain plants. It is estimated that solitary bees account for over 90% of all pollination worldwide. 

There are over 20,000 different species of solitary bees, encompassing several genera and families, including: 
- Megachilidae (leafcutter and mason bees) 
- Andrenidae (mining bees) 
- Halictidae (sweat bees) 
- Apidae (including the honeybee) 

Here is an overview of some common solitary bee species: 
- Mason bees (Osmia spp): Mason bees are metallic blue or green in color and get their name from their habit of using mud to seal off their nests, much like masons seal off rooms in a building. They are early season pollinators, emerging in spring and early summer. 
- Leafcutter bees (Megachile spp): These bees get their name from their habit of cutting circles out of leaves to use as nesting material. They are often seen rolling these leaves into tubes to create their nests. They are active in late summer. 
- Mining bees (Andrena spp): Mining bees get their name from their habit of digging nesting tunnels in soil, much like miners digging tunnels in search of gold. They can often be found in gardens and meadows. These bees are also known for their distinctive furrowed facial appearance. 
- Sweat bees (Halictidae): Sweat bees are named for their attraction to human sweat, which they believe to be a salt source. These small, harmless bees are often encountered by hikers, gardeners, and outdoor enthusiasts. 

### Solitary Bee Behavior 
Solitary bees are exactly that: solitary. Each female solitary bee works individually to lay eggs and provision them with food. They are also opportunists, often using existing cavities or pre-built nests for their eggs, which protects them from predators and harsh weather conditions. 

### How Long Do Solitary Bees Live? 
The lifespan of solitary bees varies depending on the species. Some solitary bee species live for only a few weeks, while others can live for several months. 

### Solitary Bee Threats and Survival Tactics 
Being solitary creatures, solitary bees do not have the protections of a larger colony like social bees do. However, many have developed strategies to protect themselves from predators and harsh weather conditions. For example, some will build their nests in hard-to-reach locations, while others may create multiple nests in different locations as a safeguard. 

## Stingless Bees 
### Stingless Bee Species 
As their name suggests, stingless bees are a type of bee that, unlike most bees, do not have a stinger. They are known for their docile and gentle behavior and have been used extensively in Southeast Asia for beekeeping purposes. There are approximately 500 different species of stingless bees, which can be found in Australia, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Madagascar. 

### Stingless Bee Behavior 
Stingless bees are extremely social, living in large colonies similar to those of honeybees. They are also adept at surviving in harsh conditions, making them well-suited to the climates in which they reside. 

### The Queen Stingless Bee 
Each stingless bee colony has one queen, and as with other types of bees, she is the only reproductive female in the colony. Stingless bee queens have fairly basic jobs, which primarily involve laying eggs and producing royal jelly to feed the larvae. 

### Worker Stingless Bees 
Worker stingless bees are the non-reproductive females of the colony. They gather food, clean the nest, and protect the colony from intruders. Similar to other types of bees, they have segmented bodies that divide their roles within the colony. This allows them to become specialized in certain tasks within the hive. 

### Drone Stingless Bees 
Drones are the male bees in the stingless bee colony. They arise from unfertilized eggs and exist to fertilize new queens. Drones are more prominent in stingless bee colonies than in others, comprising up to 20% of the colony's population. 

### How Long Do Stingless Bees Live? 
The lifespan of a stingless bee depends on its role within the colony: 
- Queen stingless bee: The queen can live for several years, ensuring the colony's long-term survival. 
- Worker stingless bees: Workers live for approximately 6 months, during which time they will take on several different roles within the colony. Workers in the nursery, responsible for raising young bees, live for about 2 months, while those responsible for foraging and protecting the colony live for approximately 4 months. 
- Drone stingless bees: Drones live for about 3 months and are dependent on the colony's food supply. They are expelled from the colony in the rainy season, resulting in their death. 

### Stingless Bee Threats and Survival Tactics 
Stingless bees have developed some unique survival tactics that have enabled them to survive in harsh climates. One such tactic is their ability to regulate the temperature within their colonies. They can also control their intake of water, which keeps them from drowning in heavy rains. 

## Extinct Bees 
### Extinct Bee Species 
There are many different species of bees that no longer exist, mostly due to human activities and the destruction of their natural habitats. Some of these species include: 
- Gastropottes bee: These bees, which are believed to be extinct, were known for their distinctive long proboscis, which they used to pollinate certain flowers. 
- Melittosphex: A species of bee that resembled a wasp, with a pointed abdomen and a narrow connection between the thorax and abdomen. 
- Stelis: A group of bees that were known for their long proboscis and ability to pollinate certain orchids. 

### Causes of Extinction 
Many bee species have become extinct due to human activities, such as habitat destruction, the use of pesticides, and climate change. As natural habitats are converted for human use, these species lose their homes and become more susceptible to diseases and predators. 

## Conclusion 
Bees are incredibly important insects that play a crucial role in the ecosystem. They are responsible for the pollination of approximately 1/3 of all food crops, and their honey and beeswax have been used by humans for various purposes for centuries. This article acted as a comprehensive guide to different types of bees, their characteristics, behaviors, roles, and how to identify them. 

No matter the type of bee, they all play a vital role in the ecosystem and deserve our respect and protection. By understanding the different types of bees and their unique characteristics, behaviors, and roles, we can appreciate these fascinating insects and take steps to protect and conserve them.
