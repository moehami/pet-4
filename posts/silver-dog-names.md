Not at all. You can always go with a name that you love, regardless of whether it's related to your dog's appearance or not. Silver can be a cool tone, and it is associated with things like elegance, sophistication, and style, which are desirable traits that could apply to any canine companion.

5. I'm having a hard time deciding between a few favorite names. 
If you're having a tough time choosing between a few favorite names, you can always call your dog by a different name at home while using the others as nicknames. This way, you can enjoy the uniqueness of each name without the stress of picking just one. You can also take your favorite names and add a prefix or suffix to create a brand-new option.
