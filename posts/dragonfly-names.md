**Dragonfly Names: A Complete Guide to Naming Common and Exotic Dragonflies** 

# Introduction

Dragonflies are among the most mesmerizing insects in the world, thanks to their vivid colors, agile flight, and fascinating life cycles. They are also amongst the oldest living insects, having roamed the planet for over 300 million years. If you're an enthusiast of these iridescent flyers, you may have wondered about the different types of dragonflies and how to identify them. This is a comprehensive guide that will delve into various dragonfly categories, methods for effectively identifying these creatures, and their names across different languages. By the end of this article, you should have a more comprehensive understanding of these drakes and the names associated with them. 

# Dragonfly Names and Classification

Dragonflies are part of the order Odonata and encompass species such as damselflies and dragonflies. They are integral to the ecosystem as they prey on smaller insects, helping to maintain a balance between species. These insects have a variety of names, which may vary from one region to the next. They are also classified into different groups or families based on their similarities and characteristics. Understanding the names and classifications is crucial to identifying and appreciating these beautiful insects. 

## Common and Scientific Names

Just like any other living creature, dragonflies have two names: a common name and a scientific name. The common name is what most people use to refer to a specific type of dragonfly. It is usually more approachable and easier to remember. For instance, the common dragonfly moniker is straightforward and applies to many species. The scientific name, on the other hand, is based on the Latin vocabulary and is typically more complex and descriptive. This is the binomial nomenclature that every creature is assigned, and it helps scientists and researchers categorize organisms accurately. The scientific name for dragonflies belongs to the order Odonata. 

## Classification and Types of Dragonflies

Dragonflies are classified into five different families, including: 

1. Aeschnidae (Tasers or Swiftlets)
2. Gomphidae (Snaketails)
3. Libellulidae (Skimmers)
4. Platycnemididae (Dippers)
5. Cordulegastridae (Golden-ringed Dragonflies)

These families encompass hundreds of species of dragonflies, each with its own unique characteristics, behaviors, and habitats. Let's look at each family more closely. 

# Aeschnidae - Tasers or Swiftlets

The Aeschnidae family contains the smallest dragonflies with a wingspan of approximately 2 inches. These are the dragonflies that you may refer to as tasers or swiftlets. They got their name from their distinctive appearance, which features tapered bodies and irregularly-shaped wings. These insects are typically found across the globe, excluding the extreme north and south poles. They prefer to dwell in forested areas and grasslands where there are ample low-lying trees and shrubs to lay their eggs. 

These tiny dragonflies come in a range of colors, including brown, yellow, green, and blue. They are not the most colorful species, but their brilliant wings and ability to fly swiftly make them captivating nonetheless. These insects are known to be aggressive and will readily take on birds and bees alike. 

# Gomphidae - Snaketails

Snaketails are another type of dragonfly that is distinguished by their elongated bodies and slender tails, which look like a snake's tail. There are approximately 26 known species of snaketails distributed across Asia, Africa, and parts of Australia. These insects prefer to dwell in freshwater rivers, streams, and ponds, where they can skim the water surface for prey. 

Snaketails are usually dark in color, with shades of brown, black, and blue. Their wings are relatively small compared to their bodies. These creatures are known to be fiercely independent and reluctant to interact with other snaketails. Unlike most dragonflies that perch on branches and leaves, they prefer to sit on the ground or on rocks along the water's edge. 

# Libellulidae - Skimmers

Skimmers are the most common and well-known type of dragonfly, encompassing over 6,000 species worldwide. They are relatively easy to identify thanks to their thick bodies, broad wings, and distinctive skimming flight wherein they hold their bodies parallel to the water surface as they fly. These dragonflies can be found in a wide array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, and red. They are often seen near still freshwater bodies, such as lakes, ponds, and bogs. 

Libellulidae are widespread in distribution and can be found on every continent but Antarctica. They tend to be sociable creatures, often perching in groups on vegetation close to water bodies. These dragonflies are also known to be opportunistic predators, quickly grabbing their prey as it flies past. 

# Platycnemididae - Dippers

The family Platycnemididae contains some of the most stunning dragonflies with pale orange or yellow abdomen tips. They are commonly referred to as dippers due to their distinctive behavior of dipping their abdomens in water as they fly. These dragonflies are found in Africa, Asia, and parts of Australia. They prefer living close to running freshwater and will often be found near small streams and rivers. 

Dippers are known for their insistence on hovering over the water's surface before landing. They typically have black and white bodies with pale orange or yellow abdomen tips. Their wingspan is relatively large, reaching up to 4 inches. Like libellulids, dippers also display social behavior, preferring to group together on leaves and branches close to their watery habitats. 

# Cordulegastridae - Golden-ringed Dragonflies

Golden-ringed dragonflies are found in many parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They are known for their distinctive golden rings on their abdomen, which remains visible as they grow. These dragonflies typically have a yellow and black body with brown or yellow wings. They prefer to live in forested areas near slow-moving or still water. 

These dragonflies are not as aggressive as other species, and they have a more docile disposition. Golden-ringed dragonflies are predominantly solo flyers, but they sometimes congregate near suitable breeding grounds. They are known to be resilient insects, capable of withstanding cold temperatures and less optimal habitats. 

# Dragonfly Names by Country

Dragonflies have different names depending on the country and region where they are found. In the United States and Canada, they are typically referred to as dragonflies without any distinguishing names. In the United Kingdom, they are called damsels and dragons, with the former referring to the smaller species and the latter for the larger ones. 

On the other hand, in Australia and New Zealand, they are known as dragonflies, but they may also be called moonlights, skimmers, or darners. The latter refers to the family of dragonflies, which are often found near bodies of water. In some parts of Europe, they are referred to as devil's arrow, witch's broom, or snake-jawed birds. These whimsical European names derive from ancient mythology and folklore that associated the insect's traits with various mystical creatures.
