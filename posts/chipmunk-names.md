#### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 

1. **Chipmunk Care**: Chipmunks require specialized care due to their smaller size and dietary needs. They prefer a cage with plenty of space for foraging, and their diet consists of nuts, seeds, fruits, and insects. Provide fresh water at all times and give them plenty of opportunities for exploration and exercise outside their cages. 

2. **Chipmunk Interaction**: Chipmunks are social animals and can be playful and affectionate with familiar people. With patience and proper handling from an early age, they can become comfortable with being held and interacting with their owners. However, it's important to respect their independence and provide them with hiding spots and quiet spaces when they desire solitude. 

3. **Chipmunk Enrichment**: Enrichment is crucial for chipmunks, providing mental and physical stimulation. Offer a variety of nesting materials, such as tissues, cotton, and shredded paper, as they enjoy creating cozy nests. Rotate their toys and provide climbing branches and chewing options to keep them active and engaged. 

4. **Chipmunk Diet**: Feed your chipmunk a balanced diet consisting of pellets designed for rodents, supplemented with fresh fruits and vegetables like apples, carrots, and leafy greens. Provide a small number of nuts and seeds occasionally, but avoid overfeeding high-fat foods to prevent obesity. Consult a veterinarian for specific dietary recommendations and ensure clean water availability at all times. 

5. **Handling Chipmunks**: Chipmunks can be lively and quick, so it's important to handle them with care. Support their weight by placing your hand underneath their entire body, with one finger between their legs to prevent injury. Gradually build trust with your chipmunk by offering treats and speaking gently to them. With consistent and proper handling, they can become comfortable with interaction and may even enjoy cuddling up against your hand or chest.
