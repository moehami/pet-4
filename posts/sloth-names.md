## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 

1. **Is it okay to name a sloth after a famous celebrity or fictional character?** 

It's entirely possible to name a sloth after a celebrity or fictional character. In fact, it can be quite fun and creative!

- Pick two or three top favorites and see if they sound good when combined or used in different contexts. For example, imagine announcing the name in a park or having to spell it out in a hurry. 

- If you're still indecisive, consider taking a quick poll among your friends, family, or social media followers. Sometimes, the feedback of others can help you narrow down your options more objectively.
